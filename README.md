# ^ this is my alias

Hey, it seems like you've caught me in the process of developing my website. I'll be adding consecutive updates for the website, and I'm expecting the next one to be around **August 24th, 2025**. If not, I'll update the date here to one in the future. I'm am currently working on the **design and theme** update.

Here is a quick blurb for the moment...

## A Little About Me
I'm interested in deep problem-solving, whether that's through the constructs of software engineering or the analytical rigor of research. I'm keenly interested in developing/applying algorithms effectively and understanding robust system design. I'm also passionate about clean code architecture. My goal is to not just build things, but to build them thoughtfully and effectively.
I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

## My Current Interests (sure to change in the near future)
I like to explore diverse fields that all, in their own way are fascinating and unique to one another. This includes:

- **Architecture Design**: I'm captivated by how spaces are conceived and structured, blending aesthetics with functionality.

- **Financial Markets**: The intricate systems and behavioral dynamics within financial markets present a constant stream of complex puzzles to unravel.

- **Pure Math**: There's an undeniable allure in the abstract beauty and rigorous logic of pure mathematics, where fundamental truths are discovered.

- **Satire and Stand-Up Comedy**: Beyond the laughs, I find the art of satire and stand-up comedy to be a profound form of creativity, dissecting societal issues and human nature with wit and precision.
